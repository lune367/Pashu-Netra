# Pashu Netra

## Overview
The Pashu Netra System is an AI-based image classification project aimed at identifying and analyzing the body measurements of different cattle from images. It is designed to help farmers, researchers, and livestock managers manage cattle information more efficiently through an automated image analysis system.


Note: The current version is a prototype and does not yet use a trained AI model. The classification results are generated using a randomized output to simulate the behavior of a real machine learning system. The project is currently in the development phase, and future updates will integrate an actual deep learning model for accurate cattle breed prediction.
